The Llama 3.1 instruction tuned text only models (8B, 70B, 405B) are optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source and closed chat models on common industry benchmarks.\nModel developer\n: Meta\nModel Architecture:\nLlama 3.1 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\nTraining Data\nParams\nInput modalities\nOutput modalities\nContext length\nGQA\nToken count\nKnowledge cutoff\nLlama 3.1 (text only)\nA new mix of publicly available online data.\n8B\nMultilingual Text\nMultilingual Text and code\n128k\nYes\n15T+\nDecember 2023\n70B\nMultilingual Text\nMultilingual Text and code\n128k\nYes\n405B\nMultilingual Text\nMultilingual Text and code\n128k\nYes\nSupported languages:\nEnglish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai.\nLlama 3.1 family of models\n. Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All model versions use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\nModel Release Date:\nJuly 23, 2024.\nStatus:\nThis is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\nLicense:\nA custom commercial license, the Llama 3.1 Community License, is available at:\nhttps://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_1/LICENSE\nWhere to send questions or comments about the model Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model\nREADME\n. For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3.1 in applications, please go\nhere\n.\nIntended Use\nIntended Use Cases\nLlama 3.1 is intended for commercial and research use in multiple languages. Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks. The Llama 3.1 model collection also supports the ability to leverage the outputs of its models to improve other models including synthetic data generation and distillation. The Llama 3.1 Community License allows for these use cases.\nOut-of-scope\nUse in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.1 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card**.\n**\nNote\n: Llama 3.1 has been trained on a broader collection of languages than the 8 supported languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3.1 models for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3.1 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3.1 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.\nHow to use\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original\nllama\ncodebase.\nUse with transformers\nStarting with\ntransformers >= 4.43.0\nonward, you can run conversational inference using the Transformers\npipeline\nabstraction or by leveraging the Auto classes with the\ngenerate()\nfunction.\nMake sure to update your transformers installation via\npip install --upgrade transformers\n.\nimport\ntransformers\nimport\ntorch\n\nmodel_id =\n\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\"text-generation\"\n,\n    model=model_id,\n    model_kwargs={\n\"torch_dtype\"\n: torch.bfloat16},\n    device_map=\n\"auto\"\n,\n)\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n\"role\"\n:\n\"system\"\n,\n\"content\"\n:\n\"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"\n},\n    {\n\"role\"\n:\n\"user\"\n,\n\"content\"\n:\n\"Who are you?\"\n},\n]\n\noutputs = pipeline(\n    messages,\n    max_new_tokens=\n256\n,\n)\nprint\n(outputs[\n0\n][\n\"generated_text\"\n][-\n1\n])\nNote: You can also find detailed recipes on how to use the model locally, with\ntorch.compile()\n, assisted generations, quantised and more at\nhuggingface-llama-recipes\nTool use with transformers\nLLaMA-3.1 supports multiple tool use formats. You can see a full guide to prompt formatting\nhere\n.\nTool use is also supported through\nchat templates\nin Transformers. \nHere is a quick example showing a single simple tool:\n# First, define a tool\ndef\nget_current_temperature\n(\nlocation:\nstr\n) ->\nfloat\n:\n\"\"\"\nGet the current temperature at a location.\nArgs:\nlocation: The location to get the temperature for, in the format \"City, Country\"\nReturns:\nThe current temperature at the specified location in the specified units, as a float.\n\"\"\"\nreturn\n22.\n# A real function should probably actually get the temperature!\n# Next, create a chat and apply the chat template\nmessages = [\n  {\n\"role\"\n:\n\"system\"\n,\n\"content\"\n:\n\"You are a bot that responds to weather queries.\"\n},\n  {\n\"role\"\n:\n\"user\"\n,\n\"content\"\n:\n\"Hey, what's the temperature in Paris right now?\"\n}\n]\n\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=[get_current_temperature], add_generation_prompt=\nTrue\n)\nYou can then generate text from this input as normal. If the model generates a tool call, you should add it to the chat like so:\ntool_call = {\n\"name\"\n:\n\"get_current_temperature\"\n,\n\"arguments\"\n: {\n\"location\"\n:\n\"Paris, France\"\n}}\nmessages.append({\n\"role\"\n:\n\"assistant\"\n,\n\"tool_calls\"\n: [{\n\"type\"\n:\n\"function\"\n,\n\"function\"\n: tool_call}]})\nand then call the tool and append the result, with the\ntool\nrole, like so:\nmessages.append({\n\"role\"\n:\n\"tool\"\n,\n\"name\"\n:\n\"get_current_temperature\"\n,\n\"content\"\n:\n\"22.0\"\n})\nAfter that, you can\ngenerate()\nagain to let the model use the tool result in the chat. Note that this was a very brief introduction to tool calling - for more information,\nsee the\nLLaMA prompt format docs\nand the Transformers\ntool use documentation\n.\nUse with\nllama\nPlease, follow the instructions in the\nrepository\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging\nhuggingface-cli\n:\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\nHardware and Software\nTraining Factors\nWe used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\nTraining utilized a cumulative of\n39.3M GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.\nTraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nEstimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were\n11,390\ntons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% o"
